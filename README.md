# nyt-search-react

This is a React.js app that allows you to search for New York Times articles. When you do a search you will see the  the name of the article, the date and time of publishing, You  are able to add and remove articles from a saved articles section.

## Getting Started 
1.In the CLI go to the root directory 
2. yarn install
3. In the CLI go to the client directory 
4. yarn install
5. yarn start 

** note the directory is a different set up from the one given in class( create-react-app) .  I find the current set up easier to understand**

According to reaearch for this project I had to add an extra dependency called bluebird to work with mongoose.  
const mongoose = require("mongoose");
const bluebird = require("bluebird");

## improvements needed
 
 I have to set it up to heroku not sure how to do that yet
